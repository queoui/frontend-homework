            It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age
            of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of
            belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light,
            it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the
            winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing
            before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going
            direct the other wayâ€”in short, the period was so far like the
            present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on
            its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree
            of comparison only.
